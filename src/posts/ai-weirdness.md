AI Weirdness is a comedic blog by Janelle Shane where the limitations of AI are used to hilarious effect. Some of my favorite posts include [HAT3000](https://www.aiweirdness.com/first-there-was-skyknit-now-theres-19-09-04/), an AI trained to generate crochet hat patterns that look more like brain folds than hats, and a collection of nonsensical [AI-generated personality quizzes](https://www.aiweirdness.com/which-ai-generated-personality-quiz-20-07-31/).
